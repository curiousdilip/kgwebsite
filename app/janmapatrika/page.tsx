              Astrology is the science which deals with the subject related to
              the exact prediction. existence, past, present and future. It is
              based on calculations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Astrology is a vast subject and it has no proper or final
              definition. I learned astrology when I was too young, from my
              father, who was well versed with the astrology. The astrology is
              based on the planets in the solar system who are considered
              accurate clock, their moments make revolutions and movements are
              very precise. It has its effects , influence on everyday and every
              ones life. Stars are the indication of our past Karmas, it gives
              us the direction which path we have to achieve . The influence of
              our Karmas has the direct impact on our / personal stars. They
              shape our destiny based on our Past Karmas.
            </p>
            <p>
              Astrology is the part of our daily life, it is deep rooted, its
              roots go back to the origin of this universe and shall continue.
              Life being so complex thing, many influencing things are taking
              place in our daily life, with regard to stars probably, So
              Astrology cant not taken for granted, we can say it is the whole
              some, we can say it is 90% accurate but still 10% is the effect of
              the day to day influence of the movements of stars. Even works of
              the Rishis, sages, scholars, philosphers could not make it 100%
              accurate. But a lot of accuracy can be attained if there is
              accurate timings of birth etc.
