            <h1>Hinduism in Kashmir</h1>
            <p>
              <strong>Hindu Religion,</strong> although has no proper defnition,
              but it simply reffered as Sanatana Dharma meaning "religion of the
              Vedas," an eternal Law, it is a way of living a peaceful life and
              self belief. It is in itself related to the unions of resons and
              institition, so it cant be definied but just can be experienced.
              Its belief is in reincarnation which is determined through Karma.
              It has no hard and fast rules for any Individual, every one is
              free to preach and pray the way he likes. Hinduism did not
              originate from a single person, a single book, or any defined
              time. The foundations of this oldest surviving religion were laid
              by ancient rishis (sages), who taught their disciples the eternal
              principles of life they had discovered through their meditations.
              Hindu Dharma is essentially a religion of principles based on
              teaching of ancienent Rishis and Munis. People are connected
              through its deep rooted cultural and scriptures. A Hindu can be a
              born Hindu only.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hinduism is the world’s oldest religious tradition and has no
              single founder. It is the world’s third largets regligin. The
              formost most authority texts are the Vedas & Upanishads, Bhagavad
              Gita, epics of Mahabharatra and Ramayana. Bhagwat Gita is called a
              sum up of the spritual teaching of vedas spoken by Krishna.
            </p>
            <h2>BASICS OF HINDU RELIGION</h2>
            <p>
              Hindu scriptures teach that an individual is essentially atma
              clothed in a physical body. In a human body atman is the source of
              the mind and is immortal and divine. There are two principles
              associated with atma, the bound and the liberated principal. The
              bound prinicipal is associated with a physical body, which is
              mostly related to Maya, greed and materialistic world. The
              liberated principal is get rid of this materialistic world and
              attain Moksha which is to attain spirituality.
            </p>
            <h3>Concept of God</h3>
            <p>
              The concept of God is diverse, although Many gods and avtars exist
              in Hinduism but people are devoted to a single god or couple of
              gods and avtars, while same time accepting the existence of other
              Gods and Avtars.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Gods whos are the supreme are called by different names, the
              single name given to all the gods and avtars are, Ishwar, Bhagwan,
              etc, the main focus is based on three gods , the Brahama, Vaishnav
              and Shiva and the main purpose is to get hold of atama which is
              the ultimate indistinct form of god – the supereme soul and
              reasons for Muksha – the liberation from births and re-births. The
              Hinduism is based on the Principal of Creation, preservation and
              destriction, this accounting it to Nrahama, Vishnu and Shiva. Lord
              Brahma brings forth the creation, Lord Vishnu maintains the
              universe and Lord Shiva represents the principle of destruction.
