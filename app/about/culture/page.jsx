            <p>
              Hindu culture is peaceful in nature transmitted from generation to
              generation. Hindu culture has developed from its spiritual nature,
              from the devotion to the lord, from the musicians, saints, art,
              interaction and morality etc. It does not have any defined rule as
              Hinduism itself is a way of life and not any defined religion.
              <strong> Hindu culture has its base as</strong> Sanatana Dharma
              meaning "religion of the Vedas," an eternal Law, it is a way of
              living a peaceful life and self belief. It is in itself related to
              the unions of resons and institition, so its culture can definied
              but by inheretance. It has not originate from a single person, a
              single book, or any defined time. The foundations of this oldest
              surviving religion were laid by ancient rishis (sages), who taught
              their disciples the eternal principles of life they had discovered
              through their meditations and to a large extend Indus valley
              civilization has given its vent to its Cultural. The teaching from
              the Vedas & Upanishads, Purans, Bhagavad Gita, epics of
              Mahabharatra and Ramayana. Bhagwat Gita is the base of Hindu
              culture. Since Hindusism is ethnic and cultural diversity evolved
              both by innovation and assimilation, so it has resulted in an
              enormous variety of religious traditions, ranging from innumerable
              small, unsophisticated cults to the major religious movements. The
              main themes of belief are Dharma. Samsara, karma, Moksha and Yoga.
              Hinduism is belief with no bondage, therefore Hinduism has
              developed numerous practices meant to help divinity in the midst
              of everyday life which we call culture and is in use of our daily
              life..
