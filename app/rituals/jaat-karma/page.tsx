              Kah-naether is known as Jatakaram Samskar and is one of such vedic
              samskaras as Namkaran Samskar or Mundan Samskar. This samskara is
              held on the eleventh day or, as you have said, on the eleventh
              nakshatra from the nakshtra of a child's birth, hence the name
              kah-naether. It is akin to baptism - a ritualistic propitiation of
              deities and the acceptance of a new-born child into the family
              fold or gotra. It is considered to be a very important samskara
              because no hom, havan, yagnya, shradha or pind-dana can be
              performed by the family where a new-born child has not had this
              samskara. However, if this samskara cannot be held on the eleventh
              day of a child's birth it can be deferred and held on some other
              auspicious date but before any religious ceremony is performed by
              the family. In our times it has now only vestigial importance.
              Peculiar to kashmiri pandits is Shran-sonder, a ceremony held on
              the tenth day of a child's birth; only kashmiri pandits combine
              the ceremonial medicinal bath with the vedic ritual of Pum-suam (a
              ritual now only observed in selective cases in the south of India,
              namely Kerala). And, kah-naether cannot be held if there has been
              no shran-sonder.
