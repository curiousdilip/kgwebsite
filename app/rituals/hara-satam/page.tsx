              Auspicious days of Ashada: We have three auspicious in Ashada in
              Kashmiri called Har. The auspicious days are: Ashtami - is the
              festival at Tula Mula, navami - is the festival at Chakreshwara,
              Hari Parbat, and Chaturdashi it is at Khrew to worship Goddess
              jwala. Since Kashmiri Pandit community is predominantly Shaivite
              and, therefore, worship Shiva and Shakti. They are grouped into
              three groups according to their affiliation to three different
              forms of the Goddess, Maharagnya, Sharika and jwala. And these
              threes three shrines for them are situated at Tula Mula, Hari
              Parbat in Srinagar and the hill at the village Khrew respectively.
