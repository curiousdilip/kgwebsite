              We all of know and the fact has been established that we believe
              in the Ghar Devta and it truly exists, Ghar devta we stand a God
              who invisibly lives in our house and protects s from time to time.
              So to remember him, we will all our faith and dedication, offer
              Fish food to Our Ghar Devtas on On any Tuesday or Saturday of the
              dark fortnight in the lunar month of Pausha, except when there is
              panchak With all respects and purity were prepare the Rice and
              Dish and then keep it on the roof with all arrangements, like
              sitting sheet, we clean the area with water and soil, keep
              drinking water and all this is kept under the wrap of big bowl.
              The Devta comes and eats it up to his wish and leaves the rest
              behind. The myth is we can't watch and see him.
