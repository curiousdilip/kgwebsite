            <h2>SHIVRATRI / VatukPuja / Hayrath</h2>
            <p>
              Shivratri, stands the Night of Shiva, Lord Shiva is the
              representation of the Supreme Being and the third element in the
              Hindu Trinity. The other two members are Lord Brahma and Lord
              Vishnu. Lord Shiva is known as the creator, destroyer and
              preserver of the universe. This cycle of destruction and
              recreation is always in a circle. Whenever evil tries to take
              prominence over good Lord Shiva dissolves the universe and starts
              all over again. Lord Shiva is known as the God of mercy and
              kindness. He protects his devotees from all evil that are always
              around us. He blesses his followers with grace, knowledge and
              peace.

              Shivratri or Heyrath is one among the most important festivals
              celebrated by kashmiri Brahmins, celebrating with utmost devotion.
              Shivratri is celebrated to mark the Lord Shiva’s Wedding with
              Parvati on the 13th day of the Krishna Paksha. We celebrate it for
              21 days, i.e, from Haar Ukdooh of Phagun ( Krishna Paksha ) till
              ashtami 08th of Shukla paksha of Phaguna. Kashmiris call it by
              Hayrath, the word derived from ‘hairat’, a Persian word meaning
              ‘utter surprise’. The term was coined during the Pathan occupation
              of the valley. Besides, We also call it as “ Vatuk Puja “.
            </p>
            <p>
              On this day we also Vatuk Bhairav, which is also one form of Lord
              Shiva. Year after year, the three-week celebrations begin on hur
              ukdoh, and end on theTeel Ashtami day of the bright half of
              Phalguna. Hur in Kashmiri stands for whitewashing. The first eight
              days (hur ukdoh to hur astami) are normally reserved for cleaning
              the entire house to give it a festival look and for collecting the
              necessary articles like walnuts, utensils and vatuk samagri for
              main puja on Shivaratri day. Before the main puja, a new
              earthenware, prepared by the potter Called Wagur, for the occasion
              is ceremoniously brought to the house and placed on a small
              circular seat (aasan) made of grass ( called aari ) in the Pooja
              room, commonly called (thokur kuth). the pot represents the priest
              who, according to one prevalent belief, acted as Shiva’s messenger
              to the Himalayas to seek his daughter’s hand and also performed
              the auspicious wedding ceremony of Shiva with Parvati.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the day of Trayodashi, several pots, representing various
              deities, including Vatukbhairava are embellished with flower
              garlands tied round these pots ( which we can call neck ) dried
              walnuts deposited in it. Before sun set all these pots are taken
              to river or stream and filled with water, which in Kashmir is
              called Wagur Barun. The ritual worship begins with traditional
              invocation of Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, followed by
              sanctification of the various vessels representing different
              deities. Abhishek of the Saniputul (Shiv Linga) is one of the main
              attractions of the pooja. The ritual worship continues till late
              into the night and concludes with aarti and singing of devotional
              hymns in praise of Lord Shiva. The ritual worship continues on
              other days until Umavasi.

            <p>
              Different dishes are prepared on this occasion, some prepare Veg
              food and some Non-veg as per the reet ( Reet in Kashmir is the
              continuation of the process of all earlier doings in terms of the
              meals and other ceremonial things, which one continues to do and
              can be changed / amended on certain family occasions only ) All
              dishes prepared, some prepare veg food and some non veg – as per
              reet & Revaj ( Custom ) and part of it called the Boogh is offered
              to Vatukbhairava – called Dull, which after taking meals and
              prasad is normally left under the tree. Prashad ( Naveed ) is
              distributed among all family members. ( Non veg although not
              allowed in Hinduism / Brahmanism, but the weather conditions n
              Kashmir made it compulsory for most of the people In Kashmir to be
              non – vegetarian and also considering the status of the Bhairava
              believed that he is found of No-veg, so it has become compulsory
              to make use of it ) The day after Maha Shivaratri Puja is salaam,
              means greeting. It is a free day to visit each others house to
              greet, The singing, playing, fun etc are the activities. The poor
              and the people related to our normal life like, sweeper, barber,
              labours do visit Hindu homes on the occasion to greet and to take
              their share as good will in cash or kind or both. the head of the
              family and working adults offers pocket money to children and
              other junior members in the family, including the new brides,
              sons-in-law and the newly wed daughters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Called hayrath kharch, it is also sent to nearest relations,
              including their new born and newly married children – which is
              called HERACH KHARACH. So, every hopeful one is looking this day
              to with pride. Until Amavasi, the water of the pots is replaced by
              fresh water, which is called ( wathuk Kharun ). On the day of
              Amavasi the Ritualistic Puja of the sanctified vessels reaches its
              climax, all the flower-decked vessels are taken to a stream or
              river for final ritual by ehad of the family.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the Symbolic Puja at river / stream, the vessels are emptied
              of water and the soaked walnuts are brought back to home ( Now
              walnuts are called Herach Doon / Naveed ). On return to home, the
              ladies would shut the main entrance of the house and not allow the
              head of the family to enter till he promised certain blessings and
              boons for all members of the family. The conversation would run
              as: The head of the family knocks at the closed door: Q: kus
              chuva? (Who is there?, replies the lady who has closed the door) ;
              A: Ram Bror (name of the person) ; Q: kya heth? (What have you
              brought?) ; A: anna heth, dhana heth, urzoo heth (food, wealth and
              good health etc). After the Dunya Mavas, the soaked walnuts and
              tumul chucivor (rice flour bread ) is distributed as the main
              prasad among the family members, friends and close relatives and
              every one makes sure that it reaches to all it nears ad dears
              until .
            </p>
            <h3>Significance of walnet</h3>
            <p>
              A walnut is a unit of four equal parts, which is just like the
              shape of a brain. As per hindu mathalogy the whole universe is in
              our brain, if we spritually go high we can know the whole universe
              through our brain. Another belief is that it represents Vedas also
              i.e first part of the walnut represents Rigveda, the second part
              Yajurveda, the third part Samaveda and the fourth part represents
              the Atharvaveda. All the four Vedas are equally important within
              the spirit and meaning of the Sat -Chit- Ananda and Svaroopa. The
              process of distribution of prasad continues for a week till Teel
              Ashtami, the 8th day of the Shukla Paksha of Phalguna when Hayrath
              celebratiions formally come to a ------ close. On the occasion of
              Teel Ashtami lighted earthen lamp are placed on ari (seat made of
              grass) in the morning pitra pooja is done and in the evening are
              allowed to float in the river. In addition to great religious
              significance, Shivaratri provides a wonderful and meaningful
              get-together for all members of the family. It is a day of Joy and
              entertainment. Both young and old, are in their playful mood
              during the days of the festival.

            <h3>BHAIRAVA IN HINDUSIM</h3>
            <p>
              Bhairava, an important form of Lord Shiva is worshiped by all
              Hundues / Brahamins. Bhairava, literly means “ The Terrible one”
              is the ‘wrathful’, ‘frightening’ form of Lord Shiva who is
              ‘peaceful’ and ‘auspicious’ . Abhinavagupta , an important
              Kashmiri Saiva teacher explains the popular Tantric etymology of
              the word Bhairava ( as follows: 1) Bhairava is He who bears all
              things and is supported by the universe , filling it and
              sustaining it on the one hand, while uttering it or conceiving it
              on the other. 2) Bhairava is He who protects those frightened by
              the rounds of rebirth. 3) Bhairava is the One born in the heart of
              those who, terrified by transmigratory existence, call on Him for
              help. 4) Bhairava is He Who arouses by His grace a fear of
              transmigration . 5) Bhairava is He Whose light shines in the minds
              of those yogis who are intent on assimilating time in to the
              eternal presence of consciousness and thus exhaust the energy of
              time said to be the driving force behind the machine of the
              galaxies. 6) Bhairava is the Lord of the powers of the senses
              whose shouting frightens the souls in bondage. 7) Bhairava is the
              Lord Who calls a halt to transmigration and thus is very terrible.
              There are countless forms of Bhairava each with their own name. A
              typical and widely-known form is the that of Vatukbhairava,
              worshipped mostly in Kashmir. In the Kashmir Saiva tradition ,
              Bhairava is understood as the divine form of the absolute realised
              as the exertive force that drives the senses and mind at the
              microcosmic level along with the universe at the macrocosmic
              level. Much of Kashmiri Savia practice-particularly that of the
              Doctrine of Vibration with which this volume is concerned -deals
              with how to lay hold of this inner power and identify with it .
              One way is to arouse the spiritual and cosmic energy latent in the
              soul through an expansion of consciousness brought about by the
              performance of rituals and the practice of yoga. In keeping with
              their hospitable nature, Kashimiri Brahmins offer even
              non-vegetarian food in puja to entertain Bhairavas who are said to
              form the major part of Shiva’s baaraat.
