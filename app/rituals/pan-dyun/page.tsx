              An Important festival and function. This goes with a true story
              that a King while celebrating this festival at home got furious
              and disrespected the pooja preparations, since pooja preparations
              were in the kitchen as it is the festival of making roti with all
              respects and devotion. This disrespect made the king and the
              family very poor, beg for penny, kingdom is lost, so all is lost.
              They were hit by poverty and were living in hostile in the forest.
              Finally after few years some how they managed to celebrate this
              festival again with same dedication and devotion they used to do
              it earlier and soon they had all that what they had lost. So story
              about this king is narrated at the of pooja time in home on this
              auspicious day. The myth is if some one has any problem about
              getting job, child, marriage etc, here at the pooja time he / she
              wows about celebrating this day if the needful is done within the
              year or time frame. This festival in the month of Bhadrapada, the
