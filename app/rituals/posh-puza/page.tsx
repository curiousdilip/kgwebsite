              This is called worshipping the couple with flowers. The rationale
              behind this custom is that the couple is considered to be Shiva
              and Parvati and the two are duly worshipped. First there are
              mantras for the bride and the groom separately followed by those
              meant for the two jointly. A red cloth is placed on their heads,
              and then all the people around offer them flowers in accompaniment
              of Veda mantras. This is called worshipping the couple with
              flowers.
