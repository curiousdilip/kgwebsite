            <p>
              This day is celebrated in the relation to the presence of the wild
              animal ( Yeceh ), who are who is said to be coming out of their
              caves in winter on the day of Amavasi day. So as faith we with
              great respects, prepare Moog Khedchi in the evening. On this day
              the food for Yech is kept in the plate and then on the aari ( made
              of grass ) on the wall or tree, before putting it there it is
              worshiped and Tilk and flowers put on it. The philosophy is to
              make the yech Happy to keep wild animals away from our homes.
