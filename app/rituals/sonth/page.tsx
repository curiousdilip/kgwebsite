              Sonth is the welcome to Spring season, so we celebrate it with a
              unique custom, at night we prepare a thali filled with all good
              thinks like rice, yoghurt, milk, nuts, cake, flower, pen, gold
              coin, picture of a deity or the goddess, All this is kept covered
              for the entire night and in the morning when we wake up we first
              see all these items one by one, well this the myth that all good
              come to us in this year and season so we see all these good things
              before starting out day. So as a good will we make tehear ( yellow
              rice in the morning )
